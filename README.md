### i. Source of Dataset used:

The dataset of the detailed covid-19 information has been taken from the ourworldindata(owd) github repository https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data



### ii. Reason behind the dataset choice

For the last two years, in the pandemic, thw whole world has changed drastically . Now, everyone wants to go back to their "normal" life with no thousands of deaths everyday due to pandemic. The only solution to reduce this number of covid cases is by getting vaccinated.Therefore I have chosen this data, to interpret how vaccine is actually playing an efficient role to fight against covid19.


### iii. Key insights from the data that is represented in the dashboard
From the different visualizations, I have tried to explain different insights of how vaccinations are playing a significant role. Also I have made the dashboard in such a way, so anyone can look at the dashboard and understand the insights.

- Gauge- The gauge shows the total number of people in the whole world who are currently vaccinated.
- Key influencer- This shows how the number of vaccinations,population and the number of cases are linked with each other.
- Pie Chart- Shows how many people of aged 60 and aged 70 are vaccinated.
- Table-Shows the information on hospitalised patients,new cases,,new deaths and number of vaccinated. This shows a striking difference and higlights on the vaccinations are actually significant.
- Area Chart- Show the total cases along with the date. And it can be seen in comapred to the ribbon chart that as the number of people getting vaccinated is increasing , the number of cases is decreasing.
- Ribbon Chart- Comapres the people vaccinated vs people fully vaccinated and test cases and again highlights how vaccines are working.
- Q/A source- This has a list of questions from the data source, and if anyone wants a particular answer, then that can be fetched from here.
